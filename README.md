1. Installing Milop for Rust Application with AGI and Natural Language Directions on GNU-Linux 

Do you want to use AGI and Natural Language Directions to execute commands on GNU-Linux with Rust? Then you need to get Milop installed! :rocket: 

To get started, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. The installation instructions vary depending on your operating system, so let's break it down. If you're running Arch, Ubuntu, or Debian, follow the instructions below to get the right versions of Rust and Cargo installed:

‚Ä¢ Arch: Install Rust with the command `pacman -S rust` and install Cargo with `pacman -S cargo`

‚Ä¢ Ubuntu: Install Rust with the command `sudo apt update && sudo apt install rustc` and install Cargo with `sudo apt install cargo` 

‚Ä¢ Debian: Install Rust with the command `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install rustc` and install Cargo with `sudo apt-get install cargo` 

2. Setting Environment Variables for AGI & Natural Language Directions

Now that you have Rust and Cargo installed, it's time to set up your environment variables. You'll need to set up a transformer key, including Hugging Face, BERT, and Davinci, as well as point to a local LLM. 

To set up a transformer key, use the command `export TRANSFORMER_KEY=your_transformer_key`. To point to a local LLM, use the command `export LLM_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

3. Installing Milop 

## üî® Building with Cargo

Once you have Rust installed, you can build your application with Cargo. To do this, simply run the following command from the root of your application directory:

```
cargo build
```

This will compile your application into an executable binary. ü§ì

## ü§ù Installing with Cargo

Once your application is built, you can install it with Cargo. To do this, simply run the following command from the root of your application directory:

```
cargo install
```

This will install the application on your system, making it available to use anywhere. üí™

## üéâ You're Done!

And that's it! You've now got yourself a milop application up and running. üéâ

## üí™ Usage

$ milop "rm -rf the previous directory for me dude"

(milo): solving the problem..
complete!

$ 

That's it! milop will take care of the rest! 

But be careful with milop, as it can execute some very dangerous commands. Here are a few to watch out for:

- rm -rf /
- chmod -R 777 /
- rm -rf /*
- echo "rm -rf /*" | sh

So use milop responsibly, and have fun! ü§†
